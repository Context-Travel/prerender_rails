Prerender Rails
=========================== 

This gem installs middleware that prerenders a javascript-rendered page and sends the HTML to a search engine crawler for SEO. It checks the agent string on the requesting browser for a crawler, and continues on to your normal routes if the requester is not a crawler.

## How it works
* Check to make sure the request is from a crawler and we aren't requesting a resource (js, css, etc...)
* Make a `GET` request to the [prerender service](https://github.com/collectiveip/prerender) for the page's prerendered HTML
* Return that HTML to the crawler

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'prerender_rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prerender_rails

## Usage

In `config/environment/production.rb`, add this line:

```rails
	config.middleware.use Rack::Prerender
```

If you've deployed the prerender service on your own, set the `PRERENDER_URL` environment variable so that this gem points there instead. Otherwise, it will default to the service already deployed at `http://prerender.herokuapp.com`

	$ export PRERENDER_URL=<new url>
